This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base consists of four straight legs, each positioned vertically and reinforcing the corners of the chair. Horizontal support bars connect the front legs and back legs, as well as the side pairs of legs, adding stability to the structure. The seat is a flat, rectangular surface that rests on top of the legs, ensuring a uniform platform for sitting. The back of the chair is also a flat, rectangular surface, extending upward from the rear edge of the seat, providing support for the user's back. The overall design focuses on simplicity and functionality, with each component serving a straightforward purpose in the chair's structure.
