This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, base, and armrests. The base features a cantilever structure with two U-shaped front legs that seamlessly transition from the floor to the seat, providing a continuous support loop. The seat consists of horizontal slats arranged parallel to each other, forming a series of supportive beams. The back of the chair mirrors this slatted structure with longer horizontal slats extending vertically. The armrests curve gently outward from the back and connect to the seat, offering additional support and comfort. The seat is positioned above the base, joining the back and armrests to form a unified structure.
