This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, base, and armrests. The base has a cantilever structure, consisting of a continuous tubular frame that forms two front legs and extends backwards to form a horizontal U-shape on the ground for stability. The seat is supported by this frame and connects to the back, which is slightly curved for ergonomic support. The back is a single pane above the seat. The armrests are horizontal bars extending forward from the points where the back and the base meet, providing support for the user's arms. The overall design is sleek and modern.
