This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and four-legged base. The base consists of four straight legs that extend vertically from each corner of the seat, providing stability. The seat is a rectangular form supported by the bases of the legs. The back features a rectangular frame with a cushioned panel inset, running vertically to provide support. Attached laterally to the lower part of the back and extending to the front of the chair are two armrests, adding additional support and comfort for the user. The armrests are parallel to the seat, creating a balanced structure.
