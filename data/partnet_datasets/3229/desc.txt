This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base features a pedestal structure, consisting of a circular bottom support that transitions into a slender central pole connecting to the seat. There is a curved footrest attached to the central pole for added functionality. The back has a single, continuous curved surface emerging smoothly from the seat, providing ergonomic support. The seat is positioned above the base, seamlessly integrating with the back to form a singular flowing unit.
