This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base consists of four straight legs, one at each corner, providing stability and support for the seat above. The seat is flat with a slatted surface, resting on the base, and is rectangular in form. The back of the chair is comprised of a series of three horizontal curved bars connected between two vertical sidebars, each with a decorative cut-out in the center, giving an aesthetic appeal. The structure of the back is integrated with the seat to ensure support.
