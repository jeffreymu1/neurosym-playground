This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and four legs. The base consists of four straight, vertical legs that provide sturdy support for the seat. The seat is a flat, rectangular surface that rests on top of the legs. The back is composed of a series of vertical slats, evenly spaced, that are connected by a top horizontal arch. The seat supports the back, ensuring stability, while the overall design is simple and functional.
