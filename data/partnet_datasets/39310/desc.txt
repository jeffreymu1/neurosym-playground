This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base comprises four vertical legs connected by horizontal support beams on all sides, forming a stable box-like frame. The seat is a flat rectangular panel that rests on top of the base, providing support for the back. The back of the chair features an upward extension from the rear of the seat, designed with a single gently curving rectangular panel that offers support and comfort.
