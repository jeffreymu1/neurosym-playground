This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base consists of two inverted U-shaped frames that serve as legs, providing a continuous support structure from the ground, up the sides, and connecting directly to the seat. The back and seat form a seamless curved surface, with the back extending upward from the seat's rear edge, creating a smooth transition between seat and back without clear separation. The base frames are aligned parallel to each other and positioned perpendicular to the back, providing stability and support for the chair.
