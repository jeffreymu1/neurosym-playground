This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and legs. The seat is rectangular and supported by four straight vertical legs at each corner. The back extends upward from the rear edge of the seat, featuring a ladder-back design with two vertical side posts connected by three evenly spaced horizontal bars. The seat is positioned above the legs, providing stability while supporting the back structure.
