This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base featuring a cantilever structure. The base consists of two continuous, curved lateral supports that loop from the ground to form armrests, providing stability to the structure. The seat is attached between these lateral supports, elevated above the ground. The back of the chair is a flat panel extending upward from the rear of the seat, offering support. The overall design emphasizes a fluid, modern aesthetic with the seamless integration of the base and armrests.
