This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, base, and armrests. The base consists of four vertical legs, evenly spaced at the corners, providing stable support for the seat above. The seat is a flat rectangular surface situated atop the legs, designed to support the seated user. The back is a broad, flat panel attached vertically to the rear of the seat, providing support for the back area. The armrests extend from the back, running nearly parallel to the seat, supported by vertical bars at their front ends, which connect with the front legs of the base. The design emphasizes clear, straight lines and right angles, creating a simple yet functional form.
