This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base consists of two looped structures forming the legs and providing support, with each loop creating a continuous zigzag from the ground to under the seat and down again. The seat has a slightly curved surface that is supported by the base and flows seamlessly into the backrest. The back forms a gentle curve extending upwards from the seat, providing ergonomic support. The design is minimalist, emphasizing clean lines and geometric simplicity.
