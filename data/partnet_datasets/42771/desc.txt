This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base consists of four vertical legs positioned at each corner, connected by horizontal support beams beneath the seat. The seat rests atop the base and is rectangular in shape. The back of the chair is wide and rectangular, extending upwards from the rear edge of the seat and composed of a continuous panel. Armrests are attached to the top of the front legs and extend horizontally towards the backrest, providing lateral support for the arms.
