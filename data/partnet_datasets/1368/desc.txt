This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base consists of two parallel rectangular frames that form the legs and armrests, providing lateral support and connecting to the ground at the front. The seat is a solid rectangle suspended between the frames, located above the ground. The back is a vertical rectangular section that extends from the seat between the frames, offering support. The design allows for a minimalist and open structure, with the frames forming a continuous outline from the armrest down to the ground and back up again.
