This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base consists of four vertical legs meeting the ground, providing support to the seat. The legs are positioned at the four corners of the seat, forming a rectangular footprint. The seat is flat and horizontal, supported by the four legs. The back features a series of vertical slats that rise from the back edge of the seat, supporting a solid rectangular beam at the top. The vertical slats are evenly spaced and parallel, contributing to the back's structure and support.
