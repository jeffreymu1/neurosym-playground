This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, and base. The base has a pedestal structure, consisting of a circular disk on the ground that supports a vertical central column leading to the seat. The seat is a rounded surface that smoothly transitions into the back, providing a continuous form. The back features an open, semi-circular design, connected directly to the seat, enveloping the sitting area in a curvilinear enclosure. The seat is above the base, providing stability and structural support.
