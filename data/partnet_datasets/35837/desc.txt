This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, base, and arms. The base consists of four short legs connected directly to the corners of the seat, providing stable support. The seat is wide and slightly concave in shape, forming the central section of the chair. The back is gently curved, extending from the rear of the seat and connecting smoothly with the arms. The arms are broad and curve outward from the back, running parallel to the ground, and then blend seamlessly with the front of the seat, forming a cohesive unit with the back.
