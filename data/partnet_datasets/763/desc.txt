This shape represents a chair with a back, seat, armrests, and base. The base consists of four vertical legs, each positioned at a corner, elevating the seat. The seat is a flat, rectangular surface that connects to the back and is supported on all sides. The back has a simple rectangular form, rising vertically from the rear of the seat. The armrests have a box-like structure with an open weave design and extend along the sides from the back to the front. The configuration of the armrests and back create an enclosed seating area.
