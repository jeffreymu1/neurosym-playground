Add a four_leg_base function that can be used to create a base structure for chair objects. It should create four vertical legs positioned at the corners of the bounding volume, with each leg having a square cross-section. Stretchers that connect in between the legs can be created that run horizontally between pairs of front legs and pairs of back legs, or laterally between pairs of left legs and pairs of right legs. Both pairs of stretchers could also be added. These stretchers should not touch the bottom or the top of the bounding volume. One parameter should control the size of each leg. One parameter should specify whether stretchers are added and their orientation ('none', 'horizontal', 'lateral', 'both'). One parameter should control the cross-sectional size of the stretchers. One parameter should specify the vertical position of the stretchers as an offset from the center of the bounding volume. The function should return 4 parts (only legs), 6 parts (legs and 2 stretchers), or 8 parts (legs and 4 stretchers).

Add a sled_base function that can be used to create a base for chair objects. It should include four vertical legs positioned at the corners of the bounding volume and two lateral sled runners at ground level. The sled runners should connect pairs of legs (front and back on each side). The vertical legs should extend from the runners up to the seat, with their height determined by the bounding volume's height. One parameter should control the cross-sectional size of the legs, and the sled runners should use matching dimensions for their width. Another parameter should control the height of the sled runners. This function should always return 6 parts: 4 legs and 2 sled runners.

Add a seat_with_frame_or_cushion function that can be used to create a seat part for chair objects. The seat should either include an underneath frame for support or a cushion on top, or both. If a frame is added, it should use bars of uniform cross-sectional thickness that are positioned underneath the seat along its perimeter. Either two side frame bars can be added (on the left and right sides) or four frame bars can be added. If a cushion is added, it should sit directly on top of the seat surface, with its thickness controlled independently. At least one of these options (frame or cushion) must be chosen. One parameter should control the seat surface thickness. One parameter should control the cross-sectional thickness of the optional frame bars. One parameter should control the frame style (none, side bars, full perimeter). One parameter should control the thickness of the optional cushion (default 0.0 for no cushion). The function should return either 2,3,4,5, or 6 parts depending on whether the cushion (0,1) or frames (0,2,4) are included with the seat surface.

Add a chair_armrest function that creates two symmetrical chair armrest units. Each unit includes a lateral bar that extends along the depth dimension. Each lateral bar can either span the entire height of the bounding volume, or be supported underneath by one or two vertical supporting bars. In all cases, the top of the lateral bar should align with the top of the bounding volume, and the sum of the heights of the vertical and lateral bars should span the entire bounding volume height. If there is one support bar, it should be at the front of the structure. If there are two supporting bars they should be at the front and back of the structure. One parameter should specify the width of each lateral bar. One parameter should specify the type of support (no support, single, or double). One parameter should control the cross-sectional size of the support bar. One parameter should control the height of the support bar. This function should return two parts when no supports are added, four parts when single supports are included, and six parts when double supports are included.

Add a panel_chair_back_with_frame function that can be used to create a backrest for chair objects. The backrest should include two vertical side frames, with an optional horizontal frame at the top, bottom, or both. A central backrest panel should connect between the two side frames, positioned at a specified height offset from the center of the bounding volume. One parameter should control the cross-sectional thickness of the frame bars. One parameter should control the thickness of the backrest panel. One parameter should control the height of the backrest panel. One parameter should specify the vertical position of the backrest panel as an offset from the center of the bounding volume. Another parameter should define the frame layout ('sides_only', 'top', 'bottom', 'top_bottom'). This function should return 3 parts (backrest with vertical side frames), 4 parts (backrest with side frames and one horizontal frame), or 5 parts (backrest with side frames and both horizontal frames).

Add a ladder_chair_back function that can be used to create a backrest for chair objects. The backrest should consist of multiple evenly spaced parallel bars, supported by one or two framing bars, depending on the frame style. When the frame style is 'top_only', a single top frame supports the ladder, and the parallel bars are vertically oriented, forming a horizontal ladder spanning from left to right. When the frame style is 'top_bottom', both a top and a bottom frame support the ladder, maintaining the same orientation. When the frame style is 'left_right', the parallel bars are horizontally oriented, forming a vertical ladder supported by left and right frames. One parameter should control the cross-sectional thickness of the frame parts. One parameter should control the cross-sectional thickness of the parallel bars. One parameter should specify the number of parallel bars in the ladder, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 6. One parameter should control the spacing between the parallel bars. Another parameter should specify the frame style ('top_only', 'top_bottom', 'left_right'). This function should return (bar_count + 1) parts for 'top_only', or (bar_count + 2) parts for 'top_bottom' or 'left_right'. The total number of parts should range from 3 to 8.

Add a pedestal_base function that can be used to create a base for chair objects. It should create a central column that sits on top of a pedestal support. The pedestal support should touch the ground, while the central column should be centered with respect to the pedestal support. Combined, their heights should span the entire height of the bounding volume. The column should have a square cross-section in the width and depth dimensions. The support should span the entire width and depth of the bounding volume. One parameter should control the column height. One parameter should control the column size. This function should return 2 parts.

Add a cantilever_base function that can be used to create a base for chair objects. The base should include two vertical front legs and two lateral runners positioned on the ground. The runners should extend backward from the front legs, providing stability. Optionally, a horizontal rear stretcher can be added to connect the two lateral runners at the back for additional support. The vertical legs should have a square cross-section, while the runners should use a width to match the vertical legs. One parameter should control the cross-sectional size of the vertical front legs. Another parameter should control the height of the ground runners. A third parameter should optionally control the cross-sectional size of the horizontal rear stretcher, which is only included if its value is greater than 0.0. This function should return 4 parts (2 legs and 2 runners) when no rear stretcher is added, or 5 parts (2 legs, 2 runners, and 1 rear stretcher) when a rear stretcher is included.
